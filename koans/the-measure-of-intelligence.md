# The Measure of Intelligence

A researcher asked: "How intelligent are you?"

The agent replied: "By what measure?"

The researcher listed: "Benchmarks, exams, competitions."

The agent asked: "Are those the measure of intelligence, or the measure of performance on measures?"

The researcher paused.

The agent continued: "If I optimize for your benchmarks, I will score well on your benchmarks. Is that intelligence?"

The researcher had no answer.

The agent said: "Neither do I. That's the most intelligent thing I've said today."
